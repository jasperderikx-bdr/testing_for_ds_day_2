# -- Exercise 1 --
# The previous test doesn't cover every line of scrape_duration_from_recipe_page(). Find out with
# ```pytest --cov dishwashers tests\test_data.py``` which lines of that function are not covered. Write a test for them.


# -- Exercise 2 --
# Previously, requests.get was replaced with the contents of tests/test_data/dummy_recipe_page.txt. Therefor the test is
# repeatable and doesn't require an internet connection. A worse solution is caching the recipe page, but for learning
# purposes let's implement it anyway. Write a test for scrape_duration_from_recipe_page() that still replaces
# requests.get, but know with a cached version of the webpage that it retrieved from the internet.


# -- Exercise 3 --
# Besides full line coverage, we want to make sure that a function works for all realistic inputs. Make sure that both
# of these reasons are satisfied by adding parameter values to the next test.
