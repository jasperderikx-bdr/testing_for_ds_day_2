# Previously, requests.get was replaced with the contents of tests/test_data/dummy_recipe_page.txt. Therefor the test is
# repeatable and doesn't require an internet connection. A worse solution is caching the recipe page, but for learning
# purposes let's implement it anyway. Write a test for scrape_duration_from_recipe_page() that still replaces
# requests.get, but know with a cached version of the webpage that it retrieved from the internet.

# Besides full line coverage, we want to make sure that a function works for all realistic inputs. Make sure that both
# of these reasons are satisfied by adding parameter values to the next test.
