Testing for Data Science</h2>

<h4 align="center">Day 2</h4>

This part of the training focuses on implementing tests in your data science project. This training touches upon test coverage,
monkeypatching and caching among other topics. See the slides: ```data\notes\slides_day_2.pptx```.

## âš¡ Installation

---
### 1. Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment for this repo, for instance with [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/):

```sh
conda create --name testing_for_ds -y python=3.10
conda activate testing_for_ds
```

You can use the same virtual environment for the whole training.
Note: if you just installed anaconda, you might have to initialize your terminal with ```conda init <SHELL_NAME>``` and restart your terminal afterwards.

### 2. Install dependencies

Install the project in develop mode, with:
   
```sh
pip install -e ".[develop]"
```
This will install all the dependencies listed in ```requirements.txt``` and ```requirements.dev.txt```. Have a look at them to get an idea with what we're working.

### 3. setup pre-commit

We will be using pre-commit for this project, install it with:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

If you commit your code, pre-commit will run some checks. Only if you pass the checks, the commit is completed.
For example, it checks whether you've used type-hinting. See .pre-commit-config.yaml for the full configuration.

### 4. create your own branch


```sh
git checkout -b <branch-name>
git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
```

Note: if you run into the error: "The unauthenticated git protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported.", this [stackoverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70663523/the-unauthenticated-git-protocol-on-port-9418-is-no-longer-supported) might help.

## ðŸ“‹ Assignment

---

After you completed the installation, work yourself through the exercises in the test files: ```tests\conftest.py``` and ```tests\test_<subject>.py```.
Make sure that you answer the exercises (1 to 8) in the right order.

You've completed the assignment if:
- You answered all exercises.
- All the tests pass.
- The pre-commit steps are successful.
- You pushed your code to your personal branch.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
